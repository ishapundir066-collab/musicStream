File Structure SetupYour project directory must contain the main HTML file and supporting folders for your media assets:/Infinity-Player-Project
|-- index.html              <-- The main code you were given
|-- logo.png                <-- Player logo
|-- playing.gif             <-- Animation for playing state
|-- /songs
|   |-- 1.mp3               <-- Your audio files
|   |-- 2.mp3
|   |-- ... (up to 17.mp3 as defined in the code)
|-- /covers
|   |-- 1.jpg               <-- Album cover images
|   |-- 2.jpg
|   |-- ... (up to 10.jpg, and others as needed)
⚠️ Important Note: The music player relies on relative paths (songs/1.mp3, covers/1.jpg). If these files are not present in the correct folders, the audio will not play, and the covers will not load.2. Running the ApplicationSave the entire HTML code provided into a file named index.html.Ensure you have placed your audio and cover files into the corresponding subdirectories (songs/ and covers/).Open index.html directly in your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).⚙️ CustomizationThe design is highly customizable using CSS variables defined in the <style> block:VariableDescriptionDefault Value--primary-colorMain Accent/Neon Glow Color (e.g., for icons, borders)#00e0ff (Cyan)--secondary-colorDark background for interactive elements (song items)#1a1a2e--background-colorDeepest background color for the body#0d0d18--glow-shadowDefines the actual neon shadow effect0 0 10px rgba(0, 224, 255, 0.6)...To change the theme color, simply modify the hex value for --primary-color.🎵 Updating the PlaylistThe song data is managed in the JavaScript section of the index.html file within the songs array.JavaScriptlet songs = [
    {songName: "Manma Emotion Jaage [Slowed & Reverb]", filePath: "songs/1.mp3", coverPath: "covers/1.jpg", duration: "05:34"},
    {songName: "Love Me Back - R.I.P", filePath: "songs/2.mp3", coverPath: "covers/2.jpg", duration: "04:12"},
    // ... add more songs here
];
To add a new song:Add the corresponding MP3 file (e.g., 18.mp3) to the /songs folder.Add a cover image (e.g., 18.jpg) to the /covers folder.Append a new object to the songs array, ensuring filePath and coverPath match the new file names, and update the duration.🤝 ContributingThis project is a great example of a front-end UI challenge.
